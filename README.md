To install Jerome v4's extension variant, go to the [releases](https://github.com/evvns/jerome-ext/tags) page.


# FAQ

## Why did you obfuscate parts of the code?
this is still **indev**, retard

the sole reason why i obfd it is because the api key is exposed and i dont wanna spend time rewriting it and put in webpack for env vars, ill do it at one point (maybe j4p5)

## How do I install it?
Follow the instructions you stupid fucking autist
```
- unzip the folder
- head to chrome://extensions
- in the top right corner, enable developer mode
- click on load unpacked
- click on the jerome-extension folder
done
```
